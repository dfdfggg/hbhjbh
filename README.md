Collaborative Poem

This repository is for creating a poem collaboratively by two groups. Each group will add one line to the poem in turn.

## Instructions:

1.  **Each group should work on their own branch.** The poem will be assembled in the `main` branch.
2.  **The first line should be added to file `poem.txt` by one of the groups**
3.  **In their turn group should:**
    *   Create a branch from the `main` branch.
    *   Add their line to the file `poem.txt`, following the previous line.
    *   Commit their changes with a descriptive commit message (e.g., "Add second line to the poem").
    *   Create a pull request to merge their branch into the `main` branch.
4.  **The pull request will be reviewed and merged by the repository owner.**
5.  **Repeat this process in turn until the poem is finished.**

## Groups:

*   **Group A:** https://github.com/dfdfggg/hbhjbh
*   **Group B:** 

## File:

The poem is stored in the `poem.txt` file.
